Self-learning Artificial Intelligence (S.A.I.) uses temporal input and feedback routines to achieve input recognition and appropriate output responses. The objective of the project is to provide a memory storage and retrieval mechanism, a memory transfer mechanism for replication of "trained" S.A.I. systems, and an API interface specification for external programs and/or hardware devices.
